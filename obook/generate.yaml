    ## Introduction

    Let's try to add two variables a store the result in a third variable. So we are going to need:

    | Variable | Description | Value |
    |----------|-------------|-------|
    | a        | Holds a value 'a' | 2 |
    | b        | Holds a value 'b' | 3 |
    | result   | Will wold the result of the value of 'a' plus the value of 'b' | a + b |

    ## Declaring variables

    To start we need to declare the variable 'a' with a value:

    ````javascript
    var a = 2
    ````

    Now we need to declare the variable 'b' with a value:

    ````javascript
    var b = 3
    ````

    ## Producing the result

    Now let's declare the variable 'result' with it's value being the addition of variable 'a' value with variable 'b' value:

    ````javascript
    var result = a + b
    ````

    ## Checking the result

    So now let's print the variable 'result' value. Choose one of the following lines and execute it:

    ````javascript
    result
    print(result)
    ````

    ## Conclusion

    And that's it. You can repeat this going back to the beginning and changing variable 'a' and 'b' corresponding values.
